Hey gang, in this tutorial I'll show you how we can create a readable stream and use it to read data / files. Using a readable stream means we don't have to wait for the full file to be stored in memory before we start to do something with the data.

Node.js Try Catch
Node.js Try Catch is an Error Handling mechanism. When a piece of code is expected to throw an error and is surrounded with try, any exceptions thrown in the piece of code could be addressed in catch block. If the error is not handled in any way, the program terminates abruptly, which is not a good thing to happen.

Note : It is a good practice to use Node.js Try Catch only for synchronous operations. We shall also learn in this tutorial as to why Try Catch should not be used for asynchronous operations.
